A bit more on the rustic side, we have a large open space with a field as the backdrop setting that is perfect for the couple who wants a bit more of a rustic or country setting. Indoor ceremonies typically take place in The Barn loft which has a majestic beauty with its natural wood cathedral ceiling.  Some small weddings have taken place in front of the fireplace on the main floor which provides a beautiful and cozy atmosphere.</p>
